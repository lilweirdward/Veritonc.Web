# Who we are
Our founders have been involved in the medical and healthcare industries for years, specifically in the business of treating and caring for those dealing with cancer diagnoses. Over the last several years, we noticed a need that was not being affordably met: feedback from trusted professionals about their diagnosis and recommended treatment.

With our expertise and network of qualified oncologists, we felt an obligation to provide this option for people who need it. [Our doctors](#doctors) have years of experience and can provide that extra layer of confidence that you're getting the best treatment possible.

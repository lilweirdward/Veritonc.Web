# Why choose us?
Because the treatment of cancer is complex, it may be in your best interest to gain a second opinion on your disease and treatment recommendation. A second opinion is most useful during a new cancer diagnosis, a sudden change in diagnosis or when visiting another institution for a second opinion isnâ€™t physically/financially viable.

We have several different options to best fit your schedule and lifestyle. We will need your medical records (that we can collect, or you can provide). Within 7-10 business days after we have received your records, your case will be reviewed, a second opinion will be made and you will receive a document explaining our opinions of your case as well as answers to questions you may have.
